## Unreleased

 - Use npm scripts instead of grunt

BREAKING CHANGES:

 - vagrant-solidus no longer manages the Solidus sites using the `grunt` command line. Instead, each site is started directly with its local Solidus bin (`./node_modules/.bin/solidus`). For sites that need to compile assets and run a file watcher, new scripts need to be added to their `package.json` files. For example, existing `grunt` tasks can still be used, but they need to be called directly with the two new special npm scripts:

  ```javascript
  {
    "scripts": {
      "compile-assets": "./node_modules/.bin/grunt compile-assets",
      "watch-assets": "./node_modules/.bin/grunt watch-assets"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "grunt": "~0.4.1",
      "grunt-cli": "~0.1.13"
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.0.1 (May 22, 2014)

 - Initial release

BREAKING CHANGES:

 - If you have an old version of [solidus-devbox](https://github.com/solidusjs/solidus-devbox), it's simplest to reset the whole box (this will not remove your sites' files):

  ```
  $ vagrant destroy
  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-solidus
  $ vagrant solidus-box init # Make sure to reapply your custom changes to the new Vagrantfile
  $ vagrant up
  ```
